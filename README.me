This script crops images to a square shape, resizes them to a desired size and converts them to grayscale.
The preprocessing of the images will be conducted based on parameters for the image classification in Edge Impulse. 
This step is optimal, since the image data will be converted in Edge Impulse anyways. However, it may be helpful in order to check the quality of the images before training the machine learning model to ensure that important features on the images won't be cropped and are clearly visible.
